                    <Question>
                        Flix looks quite similar to Scala. How are the two languages related?
                    </Question>
                    <Answer>
                        <p>
                            Flix borrows a lot of syntax from Scala, hence the two languages have a similar feel.
                            We think Scala made many good design choices with respect to syntax, including:
                            (a) the use of short keywords,
                            (b) the <code>x : T</code> syntax for type annotations,
                            (c) the <code>List[Int32]</code> syntax for type parameters, and
                            (d) <code>if</code>, <code>match</code>, etc. as expressions.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Other than syntax, the two languages are very different: Scala is object-oriented, Flix is
                            not.
                            Scala has sub-typing, Flix does not. The Scala type system is unsound and has imperfect
                            type inference, whereas the Flix type system is both sound and supports type inference.

                    <Answer>
                        No, but the compiler does have an interactive mode that can be started by passing
                        the <code>--interactive</code> argument.

                        Why does Flix target the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)?
                    </Question>
                    <Answer>
                        The Java Virtual Machine is a state-of-the-art virtual machine that runs on virtually every
                        platform, comes with a huge ecosystem of libraries, and supports garbage collection. While not
                        the ideal target for functional programming languages, due to its absence of tail call
                        instructions, it is still a strong choice. Moreover, if <a
                        href="https://openjdk.java.net/projects/loom/">Project Loom</a> (or similar efforts) turn out
                        successful then the JVM will offer an unbeatable feature set.

                    </Question>
                    <Answer>
                        <p>
                            At the moment, Flix has not yet reached version 1.0. That means you will be an early
                            adopter, so you should expect for the language to evolve and be prepared for the rare
                            compiler bug. (The Flix compiler has 9,500 manually written tests and we
                            take correctness seriously.)
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To write Flix programs, a solid background in functional programming is useful. That means
                            prior experience with OCaml, Haskell, Scala, or similar programming languages.

                        What is the runtime performance of Flix programs?
                    </Question>
                    <Answer>
                        <p>
                            Flix runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) hence the performance of Flix is limited by the
                            performance of the JVM. Luckily, the JVM is a mature and performant virtual machine. Flix
                            uses monomorphization which eliminates boxing and in theory can make code execute faster
                            than ordinary Java / Kotlin / Scala code. However, Flix also features full tail call
                            elimination
                            which has some run-time performance cost.

                    <Answer>
                        <p>
                            To answer this question, it is important to distinguish between <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)">latency</a> and <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throughput">throughput</a>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Flix compiler runs on the JVM hence startup times can be expensive, i.e. the compiler
                            has high latency. However, once the JVM has warmed up the compiler is quite fast, i.e. has
                            high throughput.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A simple experiment shows that the compiler runs about <code>20.0x</code> times faster
                            when warmed up compared to when cold. We estimate that Flix, when warmed up, compiles
                            around <code>20,000</code> lines of code per second, which we believe to be faster than the
                            Scala compiler, but slower than the Java compiler. We take compiler performance
                            seriously and continuously track the <a href="https://arewefast.flix.dev/">performance of
                            the compiler</a>.

                                <td>Exceptions have been used to deal with two types of errors that may arise during
                                    execution of a program: predictable errors (e.g. a file does not exist) and program
                                    bugs (e.g. stack overflow). Flix has no exceptions. Instead, all predictable errors
                                    should be encoded as partial functions (e.g. using <code>Option</code>) or as
                                    potentially error returning functions (e.g. using <code>Result</code>). We are still
                                    in the process of deciding how to handle program bugs.

                                    signatures. For example, unlike Scala or Haskell,
                                    the <code>List.head</code> function returns an <code>Option</code> since we cannot
                                    in general guarantee that a list is non-empty.

                                    between enums and integers) is a rich source of programming mistakes. In Flix,
                                    no type is ever converted to another type without explicit instruction from the
                                    programmer.

                                    to buggy code.

                                    In Flix, the equality test operator (<code>==</code>) is different from the

                                    (<code>=</code>) used in definitions and let-bindings. Flix has been designed such

                    <Answer>
                        We built the website using the popular React framework. We use JavaScript for the online code
                        editor. Using React was easy. Ultimately, we want to spend our time writing compilers, not
                        writing websites.

                        Indeed, if your computer is too old to run a modern browser that supports JavaScript then
                        probably your computer is too old to run a modern JVM that supports Flix. Sorry.

                            The latest compiler version and the website is not always in sync, hence occasionally some
                            examples may stop to work. Feel free to open a bug report if this happens.

                            <i>Do we really need safer airplanes?</i> <i>Do we really need electric cars?</i> <i>Do we
                            really need more ergonomic chairs?</i>

                        <p>
                            I mean, after all, we already have airplanes, cars, and chairs!

                            We build new programming languages and we conduct research on programming language design
                            because we want to offer developers <i>better tools to write programs</i>. We want to make
                            it <i>simpler</i>, <i>safer</i>, and <i>faster</i> to write correct programs.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            And we want to increase developer happiness. It should be a pleasure to use Flix!

                        How the fuck can anyone understand such weird syntax? I hate all these symbols.

                            The Flix syntax is <Link to="/principles/"> based on keywords</Link> except when there is a
                            <i>clearly established historical precedent</i> for using a symbol. For example:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The cons of an element <code>x</code> and a list <code>xs</code> is written as <code>x
                                :: xs</code>.
                            </li>
                            <li>The underscore <code>_</code> denotes a wildcard (or an unused variable).</li>
                            <li>The expression <code>&lt;- c</code> reads a value from a channel whereas <code>c &lt;-
                                v</code> writes a value to a channel.
                            </li>
                            <li>The symbol <code>:-</code> denotes logical implication in Datalog rules.</li>
                        </ul>

                        This is – by far – the worst syntax I have ever seen in a functional language. Semicolons,
                        braces, symbolic soup, et al. It is like if Scala, Java and Haskell had a one night stand in the
                        center of Chernobyl.
