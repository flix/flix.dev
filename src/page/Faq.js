                    <Question>
                        Flix looks quite similar to Scala. How are the two languages related?
                    </Question>
                    <Answer>
                        <p>
                            Flix borrows a lot of syntax from Scala, hence the two languages have a similar feel.
                            We think Scala made many good design choices with respect to syntax, including:
                            (a) the use of short keywords,
                            (b) the <code>x : T</code> syntax for type annotations,
                            (c) the <code>List[Int]</code> syntax for type parameters, and
                            (d) <code>if</code>, <code>match</code>, etc. as expressions.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Other than syntax, the two languages are very different: Scala is object-oriented, Flix is
                            not.
                            Scala has sub-typing, Flix does not. The Scala type system is unsound and has imperfect
                            type inference, whereas the Flix type system is both sound and supports type inference.

                    <Answer>
                        Flix has a shell that allows expressions to be entered and evaluated on-the-fly. The source
                        code of a program can also be loaded into the shell. However, the shell does not permit the
                        definition of new declarations. The shell can be started with
                        the <code>--interactive</code> argument.

                        would pick up a project to add language server protocol (LSP) support. We believe that this is
                        something that will come eventually as the language matures.

                        Why does Flix target the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)?
                    </Question>
                    <Answer>
                        The Java Virtual Machine is a state-of-the-art virtual machine that runs on virtually every
                        platform, comes with a huge ecosystem of libraries, and supports garbage collection. While not
                        the ideal target for functional programming languages, due to its absence of tail call
                        instructions, it is still a strong choice. Moreover, if <a
                        href="https://openjdk.java.net/projects/loom/">Project Loom</a> (or similar efforts) turn out
                        successful then the JVM will offer an unbeatable feature set. That said, we are keeping a keen
                        eye on developments in the WebAssembly space.

                        <p>
                            At the moment, Flix has not yet reached version 1.0. That means you will be an early
                            adopter, so you should expect for the language to evolve and be prepared for the rare
                            compiler bug. (The Flix compiler has 6,500 manually written tests and we
                            take correctness seriously.)

                        <p>
                            To write Flix programs, a solid background in functional programming is useful. That means
                            prior experience with OCaml, Haskell, Scala, or similar programming languages.

                        What is the runtime performance of Flix programs?
                    </Question>
                    <Answer>
                        <p>
                            Flix runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) hence the performance of Flix is limited by the
                            performance of the JVM. Luckily, the JVM is a mature and performant virtual machine. Flix
                            uses monomorphization which eliminates boxing and in theory can make code execute faster
                            than ordinary Java / Kotlin / Scala code. However, Flix also features full tail call
                            elimination
                            which has some run-time performance cost.

                        <p>
                            To answer this question, it is important to distinguish between <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)">latency</a> and <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throughput">throughput</a>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Flix compiler runs on the JVM hence startup times can be expensive, i.e. the compiler
                            has high latency. However, once the JVM has warmed up the compiler is quite fast, i.e. has
                            high throughput.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A simple experiment shows that the compiler runs about <code>20.0x</code> times faster
                            when warmed up compared to when cold. We estimate that Flix, when warmed up, compiles
                            around <code>10,000</code> lines of code per second, which we believe to better than the
                            Scala compiler, but worse than the Java compiler. We take compiler performance
                            seriously and continuously track the <a href="https://arewefast.flix.dev/">performance of
                            the compiler</a>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At the moment, the compilation of a Flix program pulls in the entire standard library (a few
                            thousand lines of code) and compiles it along with the program. This behaviour can be
                            avoided, by passing the <code>--Xcore</code> flag, but then data types such
                            as <code>List</code> will be unavailable. In the future, it is our plan to compile-by-need.

                                    should be encoded as partial functions (e.g. using <code>Option</code>) or as

                                    The Flix standard library has been deliberately designed to avoid common
                                    programming mistakes. We want functions that are safe and have accurate type
                                    signatures. For example, unlike Scala or Haskell,
                                    the <code>List.head</code> function returns an <code>Option</code> since we cannot
                                    in general guarantee that a list is non-empty.

                                    Implicit coercions between data types (e.g. between booleans and other values or
                                    between enums and integers) is a rich source of programming mistakes. In Flix,
                                    no type is ever converted to another type without explicit instruction from the
                                    programmer.

                                <td>
                                    In Flix, no code is ever executed before main. Flix has no static initializers (or
                                    similar constructs) which are difficult to reason about, error-prone, and often lead
                                    to buggy code.

                                <td>
                                    In Flix, the equality test operator (<code>==</code>) is different from the
                                    assignment operator (<code>:=</code>) which is different from the equality sign
                                    (<code>=</code>) used in definitions and let-bindings. Flix has been designed such
                                    that programs that mistake one for the other is unlikely to compile.

                        The language is probably great from a technical point of view, but unless Apple, Google,

                            successful. See also C, C++, Java, Python, PHP, MatLab, Perl, R, Ruby, Scala, ...
