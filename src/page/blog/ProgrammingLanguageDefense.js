                            This blog post is written in defense of programming language enthusiasts; whether they are
                            compiler hackers, programming language hobbyists, industry professionals, or academics.

                        <p>
                            In this blog post, I want to examine the discourse around programming languages and
                            especially how new programming languages are received. My hope is to improve communication
                            between programming languages designers and software developers. I understand that
                            we cannot all agree, but it would be fantastic if everyone could at least try to be
                            friendly, to be intellectually curious, and to give constructive feedback!

                            While all of the above quotes are in response to news about the Flix programming language
                            (on whose website you are currently reading this blog post), depressingly similar comments
                            are frequently posted in response to news about other new programming languages.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Why do people post such comments? And what can be done about it?

                        <p>
                            I think there are two reasons which are grounded in legitimate concerns:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Fatigue:</b> I think there is a sense that there are new programming
                                    languages coming out all the time. Paradoxically, I think there is both a dread of
                                    having to keep up with ever-changing programming languages (and other technologies)
                                    and simultaneously a sense that these new programming languages are all the same.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <b>Speech:</b> Programming languages are the material with which we craft programs:
                                    It is our way of "speaking" algorithmically. They are about what we say, how we say
                                    it, and even what can be said. Like prose, what is beautiful and elegant is
                                    in the eye of the beholder. It is not surprising then that when a new programming
                                    language comes along and suggests a different form of expression that some may have
                                    strong reactions to.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Of course there are also internet trolls; but let us ignore them.
                        </p>

                        <h2>A Point-by-Point Rebuttal</h2>

                        <p>
                            I want to give a point-by-point rebuttal to the most common refrains heard whenever a new
                            programming language is proposed.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Do we really need new programming languages?</h5>

                        <p>
                            The Flix <Link to="/faq/"> FAQ </Link> joking responds to this question with a rhetorical
                            question: <i>Do we really need safer airplanes? Do we really need electric cars? Do we
                            really need more ergonomic chairs?</i>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I think it is a valid argument. We want better programming languages because we want to
                            offer software developers better tools to write their programs. You might say that existing
                            programming languages already have all the feature we need, but I think that there are
                            exciting developments; both brand new ideas and old research ideas that are making their
                            way into new programming languages:
                        </p>

                                <li>
                                    <b>Safety:</b> region-based memory management, lifetimes, ownership types, linear
                                    types, 2nd class values, and capabilities.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Expressiveness:</b> union and intersection types, polymorphic effect systems,
                                    algebraic effects, type-driven development, increasingly powerful type inference.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Development Experience:</b> the Visual Studio Code ecosystem, the language server
                                    protocol, GitHub code-spaces.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I don't think we are anywhere near to the point where programming languages are as good as
                            they are ever going to get. On the contrary, I think we are still in the infancy of
                            programming language design.
                        </p>

                        <h5>All programming languages are the same</h5>

                        <p>
                            I strongly disagree. I think we are experiencing a period of programming language
                            fragmentation after a long period of consolidation and stagnation. For the last 15-years or
                            so, the industry has been dominated by C, C++, C# and Java. The market share of these
                            programming languages was always increasing and they were the default safe choice for new
                            software projects.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Today that is no longer the case. The ecosystem of programming languages is much more
                            diverse (and stronger for it). We have Rust. We have Scala. We also have Go, Python, and
                            JavaScript. There is also Crystal, Elixir, Elm, and Nim (Oh, and Flix of course!) We are in
                            a period of fragmentation. After a decade of object-oriented ossification we are entering a
                            new and exciting period!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If history repeats itself then at some point we will enter a new period of consolidation.
                            It is too early to speculate on which programming languages will be the winners, but I feel
                            confident that they will be much better than C, C++, C#, and Java! (Ok, maybe C++30 will be
                            one of them &ndash; that language changes as much as Haskell!)
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            (Addendum: That said, it is true that many hobby programming languages look the same. But
                            there is a reason for that: if you want to learn about compilers it makes sense to start by
                            implementing a minimal functional or object-oriented programming language.)
                        </p>

                        <h5>New programming languages are too complicated!</h5>

                        <p>
                            That's the way of the world.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            What do you think an airline pilot from the 1950's would say if he or she entered the flight
                            deck of an Airbus A350? Sure, the principles of flying are the same, and indeed iteration
                            and recursion are not going anywhere. But we cannot expect everything to stay the same. All
                            those instruments are there for a reason and they make flying safer and more efficient.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As another example, once universities start teaching Rust (and we will!) then programming
                            with ownership and lifetimes will become commonplace. As yet another example, today every
                            programmer can reasonably be expected to know about <code>filter</code> and <code>map</code>,
                            but that was certainly not the case 15 years ago!
                        </p>

                        <h5>A programming language cannot be successful unless a major tech company is behind it</h5>

                        <p>
                            Historically that has not been true. Neither PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, or Scala had
                            major tech companies behind them. If industry support came, it came at a later time.
                        </p>

                                    to existing languages? Does the language make you think in a new way about

                                    Do you have backing (from industry or otherwise)?

                                    compiler really outperform modern state-of-the-art C compilers? Is your type system
                                    really more expressive than Haskell or Idris? Is your language really safer than
                                    Ada?

                                    <b>Scope:</b> We are building a real programming language intended for real-world
                                    use. It is an open-source project lead by academic programming language researchers.

                                    <b>Implementation:</b> The Flix compiler project is ~137,000 lines of code. We have
                                    a realistic compiler, a standard library (extensive, but still under development), a
                                    Visual Studio Code extension (with auto-complete!), an online playground, online
                                    documentation, and several published papers on the novel aspects of the language.

                                    <b>Novelty:</b> We have a whole page (<Link to="/innovations/">Innovations</Link>)
                                    that covers this, but briefly: a unique combination of features, combined with
                                    first-class Datalog constraints and a polymorphic effect system.

                                    <b>Resources:</b> We are a group of programming language researchers from Aarhus
                                    University and the University of Waterloo together with a small community of open
                                    source contributors. Through our research we have funding for working on Flix.

                                    better, and what it would take for someone to consider using it.

                                    <b>Reality Check:</b> We aim to under-promise and over-deliver. We do not promote
                                    features before they exist. Our typical pipeline is: (Research) Idea →
                                    Implementation → Documentation → Presentation to the World. Development is not
                                    secret; everything is on GitHub. We just don't promote anything before it is ready.
                                    We have exciting things in the pipeline, but you will have to wait a bit before
                                    learning about them (or spoil yourself by diving into the GitHub issues!)
