                        <p>
                            As software developers, we strive to write correct and maintainable code.
                            Today, I want to share some code where I failed in these two goals.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I will show you real-world code from the Flix compiler and ask you to determine what is
                            wrong with the code. Then, later, I will argue how programming languages can help avoid the
                            type of problems you will see. (Note to the reader: The Flix compiler is (currently) written
                            in Scala, so the code is in Scala, but the lessons learned are applied to the Flix
                            programming language. I hope that makes sense.)

                        <p>
                            Let us begin our journey by looking at the following code fragment:
                        </p>

                        <InlineEditor>
                            {`case Expression.ApplyClo(exp, args, tpe, loc) =>
    val e = visitExp(exp)
    val as = args map visitExp
    Expression.ApplyClo(e, as, tpe, loc)

case Expression.ApplyDef(sym, args, tpe, loc) =>
    val as = args map visitExp
    Expression.ApplyDef(sym, as, tpe, loc)

case Expression.Unary(op, exp, tpe, loc) =>
    val e = visitExp(exp)
    Expression.Unary(op, exp, tpe, loc)

case Expression.Binary(op, exp1, exp2, tpe, loc) =>
    val e1 = visitExp(exp1)
    val e2 = visitExp(exp2)
    Expression.Binary(op, e1, e2, tpe, loc)`}
                        </InlineEditor>

                        <p>
                            Do you see any issues?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If not, look again.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Ok, got it?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The code has a subtle bug: In the case for <code>Unary</code> the local
                            variable <code>e</code> holds the result of the recursion on <code>exp</code>. But by
                            mistake the reconstruction of <code>Unary</code> uses <code>exp</code> and
                            not <code>e</code> as intended. The local variable <code>e</code> is unused. Consequently,
                            the specific transformations applied by <code>visitExp</code> under unary expressions are
                            silently discarded. This bug was in the Flix compiler for some time before it was
                            discovered.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Let us continue our journey with the following code fragment:
                        </p>

                        <InlineEditor>
                            {`case ResolvedAst.Expression.IfThenElse(exp1, exp2, exp3, tvar, evar, loc) =>
    for {
        (tpe1, eff1) <- visitExp(exp1)
        (tpe2, eff2) <- visitExp(exp2)
        (tpe3, eff3) <- visitExp(exp3)
        condType <- unifyTypM(mkBoolType(), tpe1, loc)
        resultTyp <- unifyTypM(tvar, tpe2, tpe3, loc)
        resultEff <- unifyEffM(evar, eff1, eff2, loc)
    } yield (resultTyp, resultEff)`}
                        </InlineEditor>

                        <p>
                            Do you see any issues?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If not, look again.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Ok, got it?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The code has a similar bug: The local variable <code>eff3</code> is not used, but it
                            should have been used to compute <code>resultEff</code>. While this bug never made it into
                            any release of Flix, it did cause a lot of head-scratching.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now we are getting the hang of things! What about this code fragment?:
                        </p>

                            {`/**
  * Returns the disjunction of the two effects \`eff1\` and \`eff2\`.
  */
def mkOr(ef1f: Type, eff2: Type): Type = eff1 match {
  case Type.Cst(TypeConstructor.Pure) => Pure
  case Type.Cst(TypeConstructor.Impure) => eff2
  case _ => eff2 match {
    case Type.Cst(TypeConstructor.Pure) => Pure
    case Type.Cst(TypeConstructor.Impure) => eff1
    case _ => Type.Apply(Type.Apply(Type.Cst(TypeConstructor.Or), eff1), eff2)
  }
}`}
                        </InlineEditor>

                        <p>
                            Do you see any issues?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I am sure you did.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The bug is the following: The formal parameter to <code>mkOr</code> is
                            misspelled <code>ef1f</code> instead of <code>eff1</code>. But how does this even compile,
                            you ask? Well, unfortunately the <code>mkOr</code> function is nested inside another
                            function that just so happens to have an argument also named <code>eff1</code>!
                            Damn Murphy and his laws. The intention was for the formal parameters
                            of <code>mkOr</code> to shadow <code>eff1</code> (and <code>eff2</code>), but because of the
                            misspelling, <code>ef1f</code> ended up as unused and <code>eff1</code> (a completely
                            unrelated variable) was used instead. The issue was found during development, but not
                            before several hours of wasted work. Not that I am bitter or anything...
                        </p>

                            I am sorry if that was unfair. But was it really? The Flix code base is more than 100,000
                            lines of code, so it is hard to imagine that a single person can hold it in his or her head.

                        <p>
                            As these examples demonstrate, and as has been demonstrated in the research literature (see
                            e.g. <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~engler/p401-xie.pdf">Xie and Engler 2002</a>),
                            redundant or unused code is often buggy code.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To overcome such issues, Flix is very strict about redundant and unused code.

            unused local variable.


Possible fixes:

  (1)  Use the local variable.
  (2)  Remove local variable declaration.
  (3)  Prefix the variable name with an underscore.

                        <p>
                            The problem with the code is that the evaluation of <code>List.map(x -{">"} x + 1, 1 :: 2 ::
                            Nil)</code> has no side-effect(s) and its result is discarded.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Another classic instance of this problem is when someone calls
                            e.g. <code>checkPermission(...)</code> and expects it to throw an exception if the user has
                            insufficient permissions, but in fact, the function simply returns a boolean which is then
                            discarded.

                            But this is <i>not</i> your Grandma's average compile-time error. At the time of writing, I
                            know of no other programming language that offers a similar warning or error with
                            the same precision as Flix. If you do, please drop me a line on Gitter. (Before someone
                            rushes to suggest <code>must_use</code> and friends, please consider whether they work in
                            the presence of polymorphism as outlined below).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The key challenge is to (automatically) determine whether an expression is pure
                            (side-effect free) in the presence of polymorphism. Specifically, the call
                            to <code>List.map</code> is pure because the <i>function argument</i> <code>x -{">"} x +
                            1</code> is pure. In other words, the purity of <code>List.map</code> depends on the purity
                            of its argument: it is <i>effect polymorphic</i>. The combination of type inference,
                            fine-grained effect inference, and effect polymorphism is a strong cocktail that I plan to
                            cover in a future blog post.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Note: The above is fully implemented in master, but has not yet been "released".

                        <h5>Closing Thoughts</h5>

                        <p>
                            I hope that I have convinced you that unused code is a threat to correct and maintainable
                            code. However, it is a threat that can be neutralized by better programming language design
                            and with minor changes to development practices. Moreover, I believe that a compiler that
                            reports redundant or unused code can help programmers &ndash; whether inexperienced or
                            seasoned &ndash; avoid stupid mistakes that waste time during development.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A reasonable concern is whether working with a compiler that rejects programs with unused
                            code is too cumbersome or annoying. In my experience, the answer is no. After
                            a small learning period, whenever you want to introduce a new code fragment that will not
                            immediately be used, you simple remember to prefix it with an underscore, and then later you
                            come back and remove the underscore when you are ready to use it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            While there might be a short adjustment period, the upside is <i>huge</i>: The compiler
                            provides an iron-clad guarantee that all my code is used. Moreover, whenever I refactor some
                            code, I am immediately informed if some code fragment becomes unused. I think such long-term
                            maintainability concerns are significantly more important than a little bit of extra work
                            during initial development.
                        </p>
