                    <p>
                        A typical internship lasts 8-10 weeks in the summer period (but other times of year
                        may also be possible).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Aarhus University will reimburse travel and visa costs for coming to Denmark.
                        In addition, it is possible to apply for a small stipend to help cover housing and living
                        expenses.

                    <p>
                        To apply, you should be enrolled in a bachelor's or master's degree programme at an accredited
                        university.
                    </p>

                        We are looking for candidates that have experience with compilers,
                        programming languages, and functional programming â€” either through course work or from
                        working on their own language.
